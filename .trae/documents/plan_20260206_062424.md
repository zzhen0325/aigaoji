The issue is caused by the chart data missing the 09:30 start point or having gaps, and the fallback mechanism incorrectly setting the start value to the current profit value, resulting in a flat line or single point.

I will modify `src/pages/portfolio/Portfolio.tsx` to:
1.  **Fix `fallbackData`**: Set the 09:30 point value to `manualTotal` (usually 0) instead of `baseValue` (current profit). This ensures the fallback chart shows a trend from 0 to the current profit.
2.  **Ensure Start Point**: In `buildPortfolioIntradayData`, explicitly prepend a data point for '09:30' with value `manualTotal` if it's missing from the fetched data. This guarantees the chart always has a starting anchor and at least two points to render a line.

This will ensure the "Intraday Profit" chart always starts from 0 (or the manual baseline) at 09:30 and connects to the latest available data, resolving the single point display issue.
